# Commands Used

All of these ran at the root folder (where this README.md file is located) 
`~/Developer/advent-of-code/2023/rust/day-22`

This is because at the root folder, there is a Cargo.toml file, which is the 
manifest for Rust's package manager. This file contains all the metadata for the project, such as the name, version, authors, dependencies, etc. It is crucial for building and running the Rust project.
